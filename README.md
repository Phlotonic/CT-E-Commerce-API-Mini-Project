Auto-Restock
The application uses APScheduler to automatically restock products when their stock falls below a defined threshold (RESTOCK_THRESHOLD). The restocking logic is defined in the restock_products() function. Currently, it's configured to run daily at midnight. You can adjust the schedule and the restocking logic as needed.

Postman Collection
A Postman collection (e_commerce_db.postman_collection.json) is included in the postman_collections folder. You can import this collection into Postman to easily test the API endpoints.
